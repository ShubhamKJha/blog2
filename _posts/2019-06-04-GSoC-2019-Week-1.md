The first week of official Coding Period is over and it went well ðŸ˜„.

As proposed, I created a branch over [#7608](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/7608) and went through it locally. I have made certain improvements and I will create appropriate PR for them this week. I intend to get that merged in this week only, if everything goes well. Also, as suggested by Aaron, I looked for profiling tools for optimizing slow parts in the codebase. I will be using [**pyinstrument**](https://pypi.org/project/pyinstrument/) and the profiler of PyCharm for this purpose.

Later in this week, I started the PR [#16956](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16956) which fixes issues [#16915](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/16915) and [#16582](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/16582). Both these issues are related to assumptions handling in Relationals. It broke more code than expected ðŸ˜…. This shows how embedded the old assumptions are in the codebase. I will try to fix them ASAP.

With the first week wrapped up, in the next week :

* I will create an experimental PR to include `complex -> finite` in the old assumptions. This is going to break `zoo.is_complex` overall. I will try to do it without including new facts. [#16666](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16666) shows how difficult such proceedings can be.
* I will also create a PR to include `complex -> finite` in the new assumptions. This should be easier than the former. The new assumptions is still not used much in the codebase ðŸ˜Œ.

I will try to shift my focus more towards the new assumptions. But I will also look for any major inconsistency between the assumptions systems.

With this, sign out for the next week.
