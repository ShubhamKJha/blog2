Finally, the result of GSoC-2019 came on 6<sup>th</sup> of May, 2019. I am very happy to inform that my [proposal](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/wiki/GSoC-2019-Proposal-Shubham-Kumar-Jha-:-Improving-Assumptions) on improving the assumptions mechanism has been accepted by SymPy for this year's GSoC. For those who don't know, SymPy is an open-sourced Computer Algebra System([CAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_algebra_system)) written in Python. It was started by Ondrej Cetrik([@cetrik](https://github.com/cetrik)) in 2006, as a project. Since 2007, SymPy has participated in Google Summer of Code every year. GSoC has given much boost to the development of SymPy's codebase.

My official mentors will be Aaron Meurer([@asmeurer](https://github.com/asmeurer)) and Kelevi Suominen([@jksuom](https://github.com/jksuom)). Aaron(who joined from GSoC) is also the lead developer of SymPy. For the next three months, I will be working on my project under their guidance.

GSoC happens in phases. The official coding period will begin from 27<sup>th</sup> of May, 2019. Before that, the first phase is the *Community Bonding Period*. My plans for this period include:
* Setting up a blog and synchronizing it with [planet.sympy.org](https://planet.sympy.org/).
* Discussing with my mentors about the possible means of communication and weekly meetings.
* Planning about the implementation of the project.

I have been contributing to SymPy for the past four months. I am very happy to be a part of it.

Looking forward to a great summer with SymPy.

**Disclaimer**:There will be a lot of posts after this 😄
