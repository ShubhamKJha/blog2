The third week of coding period has ended and as I already stated in the last blog, I couldn't be much productive this week. Nevertheless, I tried to wrap-up some unfinished works. PR [#16956](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16956) is ready to merge, just waiting for some last reviews. This PR needs to be supplemented with some fixes in the code of `Add` class to handle all the issues over `Relationals`. PR [#16978](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16978) had one major failing test from the `stats` module. I tried to debug it ,but due to my unfamiliarity with that part of code I took help from [Gagandeep](https://github.com/czgdp1807) and as his [comment](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16978#discussion_r294039337) suggests, the result this PR is giving is correct and more intuitive. At least, one less issue to handle ðŸ˜Œ.

Over the end of the week, I shifted my focus towards *New Assumptions*. One of my major tasks for this summer is to speed up the *satask* module. As suggested by Aaron, I searched the repository for issues and PRs over this, and I found a number of such unfinished work. I would need to study these ideas and profile the results before working ahead. I would create a issue-tree over it connecting all such PRs and there respective benchmarks.

For this week, I would focus on the above mentioned task only. Since the first phase is about to end, I would have to speed things up.
