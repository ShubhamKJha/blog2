I spent most of this week getting [#17144](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/17144) ready to be merged. I had to change a lot of things from the last attempt. One of such was an attempt on **early encoding**, I had tried it on **Literals**. They were eventually going to be encoded so I tried to do this when **Literals** were created only. But as Aaron suggested, my approach had left encodings in the global space and hence could leak memory. During the week, I tried to attach encoding to the **CNF** object itself but it would have needed a lot of refactoring, since **CNF** objects interacted with other such objects. So, after some attempts, at the end I left the encoding to be done at last in **EncodedCNF** object. Currently, this is ready to be merged.

For the coming weeks, I would try to improve over this.

This was also the week for second monthly evaluation and I feel happy to announce that I passed it. From this week my college has also started but I am still able to give the required time to this project and complete it.

Will keep you updated. Thank you !
